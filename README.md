# Re-Design-Website-Desa-Wisata-Parlondut
Parlondut Village is a Tourism Village located in Pangururan District, Samosir Regency, North Sumatra. I did a re-design on this website because it is a project assignment for the Human and Computer Interaction course at my Institute, Del Institute of Technology. This project is a project that I worked on when I was in Semester 3.
